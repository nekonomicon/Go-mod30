Skin Uploading Rules:

There are Several Rules for presenting Skins on this site.
If you are violating them, your Thread will be locked

+ Upload only Skins you made, or you have permission for this
  (or they dont care about it)
+ The skins should be Skins, not something else.
+ CSS Weapon Portations are gay.
+ HL2 Weapon Portations are even more gay.
+ Everything else ported from Source Engine Games
  is gay.
